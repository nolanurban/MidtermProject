<h2 align="center">Description</h2>
<p>This application is a hub for Users to create and update a Book Club(s). It allows Users to review books, create and update reading lists, and manage Book Clubs.</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>
<a name="readme-built"></a>
<h2 align="center">Built With</h2>
<p>This application was built with Java, git, SpringToolSuite, BootStrap, SpringBoot, css, and jsp.</p>
<p>During the production of this application, we used an agile development style and met daily during a scrum meeting. We also utilized a trello board for organizing tasking for this project.</p>
<a name="readme-learned"></a>
<h2 align="center">Things learned</h2>
<p>During production of this application, we learned how to more effectively use an agile development style and gained better understanding of how to use git for version management.</p>
<p>We continued to build our communication skills while working on this project--which has been the biggest project each of us has worked on thus far--and ensured that our product was functioning the way the entire team intended.</p>

<a name="readme-future"></a>
<h2 align="center">Things to do next time</h2>
<p>Given more time for the development phase, and with more knowledge with the utilized technologies, we had planned for a stretch goal of user messaging to better facilitate coordination for meeting of a book club. We would also like to have added the ability to search/add books not currently contained in the database through use of the GoogleBooks API. A stretch goal that would also require more time and/or knowledge would be storing images for user and bookclub profiles on the website, rather than storing an image url in the database.</p>
<p>Also given more time, we would have liked to improve the UI of the website further, making the website feel more natural and professional.</p>
<a name="readme-note"></a>
<h2 align="center">Things of Note</h2>
<p>Of note, a user is able to perform crud operations on almost all of the database tables, and the search methods for our application is fairly robust, allowing a user to accurately find the item they are looking for.</p>
